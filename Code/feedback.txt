Good work let down by a major bug and weak report.


You don't correctly implement the rule that captures must be taken if
available. E.g. in the following position you give the move 11 15 which is
a possible move but is illegal because the capture can be made from 13 to 22,
capturing square 17.

g 8 8 100
p 1 0
r 12 1 2 3 4 9 6 7 8 10 11 12 13
w 12 17 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32

The format you print for moves is wrong in a couple of ways. First there are
are unnecessary quotes in the print, and second the move is incremented and it
was meant to print out the current move number. (I fixed these in order to
test the program against my random player and it was then I found the bug
mentioned above.)

The report is very brief, so give very little on design decisions or
discussion of how your program plays. It would be good for example to see a
game it played against itself.
